From a code remote to master
git pull code master

A: If the branch that we wanna merge has 3 commits after the branching and the branch we want it to be merged into has no commits after the branching,
   then we perform a FAST FORWARD MERGE
B: If the branch that we wanna merge has 3 commits after the branching and the branch we want it to be merged into has 3 commits after the branching, 
   then we perform a 3 WAY MERGE.

git merge BRANCH_X --no-ff -m "A message of our choice"

This could be the reasons for the confilcts:
A.If we tried to make a change on a single line on both fix and develop.
B.One file is updated and deleted on fix and develop.
To fix this, 
 We could take the easy way out and reverse back the merging: HOW TO DO IT: git merge --abort
 Another way is taking the long way and actualy fixing it. There are going to be conflcit markers on the files with a conflict so we can go and fix it.
5.
git push origin master
git push origin develop
